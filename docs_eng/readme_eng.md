# ALU 74181 SIMULATOR

This simulator faithfully reproduces the behavior of the **74181** chip, one of the first integrated **ALUs (Arithmetic Logic Units)**, designed in the 1970s by Texas Instruments. It is considered a milestone in computer history, as it enabled the creation of more complex and modular CPUs.

The project presented here is much more than a simple emulation: it represents a **didactic, experimental, and engineering** environment to deeply understand the functioning of low-level logical and arithmetic operations.

## Technical Features

The simulator offers a range of advanced features for study and experimentation:

* **Full simulation** of the 4-bit 74181 chip
* **Extension to 32 bits** through cascading architecture (as in real CPUs)
* Implementation of **PIPO (Parallel-In/Parallel-Out)** registers using SR flip-flops
* **Automatic detection of the host CPU** and clock frequency estimation to simulate real clock cycles
* **Cross-platform compatibility:** designed to run on Windows, Linux, and macOS

## Educational and Professional Use

This tool is designed to support various contexts:

* **Ideal for university courses** in Computer Architecture, Digital Logic, and Retrocomputing.
* Useful for **testing microinstructions** and control logic at the component level.
* Advanced tool for makers and digital electronics enthusiasts.

## Notes on Interface and Language

By default, the simulator menu is displayed in **Italian**. However, the user can switch the interface language by selecting the option **[7] Cambiare lingua (Change language)** from the main menu.
