FIXED BUGS â€“ ALU Simulator

1. [BUG #001] User Interface Frozen on Non-Numeric Input

   * Description: When an alphanumeric character was entered where a number was expected, the simulator entered an infinite loop.
   * Resolution: Implemented input validation and error handling.

2. [BUG #002] Improved Input Buffer Management

   * Description: The previous buffer cleaning method (`pulire_buffer()`) could sometimes leave residual characters in memory after using `scanf()`.
   * Resolution: The function was optimized and redefined to flush the buffer up to the newline character (`\n`) or the end of file (EOF), ensuring more robust and reliable user interface behavior.

3. [BUG #003] Code Overhead and Complexity

   * Description: The code exhibited excessive overhead due to:
     a) A complex delay system
     b) Unnecessary dynamic memory management for temporary results
   * Resolution: The overhead was drastically reduced through a complete refactoring: the timing system was replaced with a scalable and constant model.

4. [BUG #004] Improved I/O Register Interaction**

   * Description: The interaction between output registers and the I/O system was not optimized.
   * Resolution: The update and data presentation routines for output registers were streamlined and harmonized.

FINAL NOTES:
All known bugs have been resolved. No critical malfunctions have been detected during standard testing.
